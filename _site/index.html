  <p>I am building an app to create a REST API with Node.js</p>
  <p>Let's take a look at how I will go about it with...</p>

  <h1>the 5 w's</h1>

  <h2>Who</h2>
  <p>Mostly my tutor Jamal, my mentor Sam, my studdy buddy Wayne, and all other super lucky developers whose eyes will be graced with the site of my code. jk!<br> According to the documentation they will be working on the client-side for the app
    based on what's been documented on the server-dise.</p>
  <p>***Also, all general movie lovers and knowers of fine things.</p>
  <h2>What</h2>
  <p>The complete server­side of your web application including the server, business logic, and business layers of the application. It will consist of a well­designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and
    MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non­relational way.</p>
  <h2>When</h2>
  <p>Whenever users of myFlix are interacting with the application, the server­side of the application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the data in the database. These users will be able to use the myFlix
    application whenever they like to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their list of “Favorite Movies.”</p>
  <h2>Where</h2>
  <p>The application will be hosted online. The myFlix application itself is responsive and can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.</p>
  <h2>Why</h2>
  <p>Movie enthusiasts want to be able to access information about different movies, directors, and genres. The server­side of the myFlix application will ensure they have access to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all
    necessary data can be stored</p>
